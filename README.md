# Terraform Avi Load Balancer Automation

Welcome to the Terraform repository for automating the creation of Avi Networks load balancer objects.

## Overview

This Terraform configuration enables you to automate the provisioning and management of Avi Networks load balancer objects. Avi Networks provides software-defined load balancing and application delivery services, offering features like SSL termination, content switching, and application security.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define your Avi Networks load balancer configuration as code using Terraform, enabling version control, reproducibility, and automation.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Easily define and adjust your load balancer configuration parameters such as virtual services, pools, health monitors, and more.
- **Automation:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines or trigger Terraform runs via infrastructure change events to automatically provision or update Avi Networks load balancer objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine or your CI/CD environment.
- Access to an Avi Networks Controller.
- Avi Networks Terraform provider configured in your environment.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or your CI/CD environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haddadv2/Avi_Terraform.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

    -  for example: Nginx Annotations to Avi objects

    ```bash
    cd NginxAnnotations_Equivalent

3. Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init

4. Review and customize the main.tf file to define your Avi Networks load balancer configuration.

5. Apply the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform apply

6. Confirm the changes and apply them by typing yes.

7. Once the Terraform apply completes successfully, your Avi Networks load balancer infrastructure will be provisioned according to the configuration defined in Terraform.
